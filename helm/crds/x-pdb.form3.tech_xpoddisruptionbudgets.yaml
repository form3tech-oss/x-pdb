                  An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by
                  "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of
                  the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions
                  by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable".

                  An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by
                  "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the
                  absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary

                  XPDB allows workload owners to define a disruption probe endpoint.
                  It might be helpful to probe internal state of some workloads like databases
                  to verify wether an eviction can happen or not.
                  Database Raft groups might become unavailable if a given pod
                  is disrupted. In these cases workload owners might want to
                  block disruptions to happen, even if all pods are ready.

                  A XPDB can be suspended, hence allowing pod deletion of pods matching this pdb.
                  This is intended to be used as a break-glass procedure
                  to allow engineers to take manual action on Pods which
                  must not be disrupted.
                  The suspension is configured on a per-cluster basis
                  and does only affect local pods. I.e. other clusters
                  that run x-pdb will not be able to evict pods if there
                  isn't enough disruption budget available globally.
                  To allow disruptions in other clusters one must set the `suspend` field to true
                  in those clusters as well.
