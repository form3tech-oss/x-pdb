# X-PDB

X-PDB allows you to define multi-cluster PodDisruptionBudgets and blocks evictions or Pod deletions when they are too disruptive.

This allows you to operate stateful workloads spanning multiple clusters and limit disruptions to a necessary minimum.
This is needed, because each cluster acts individually (evictions, rolling out updates etc) which may cause service disruptions simultaneously across clusters.
